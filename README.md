# Introduction 
Our application is a website called "Communication Solutions" that serves as a platform for business owners to explore the services offered by the company, including coaching and business consultations. It presents an easy and efficient way for customers to quickly come in contact with the company, learn about its history, and schedule an appointment to get started with them. Additionally, the platform streamlines scheduling, consultation tracking, and cliental management helping the company operate.

The website was created to support the company's mission of helping other businesses grow and expand their success through guidance and resources. Recognizing that the website is the first step in the door for customers, the goal was to create a user-friendly platform that potential clients can follow while also showcasing the company's values and efforts.
